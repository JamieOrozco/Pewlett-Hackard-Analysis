# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview:

The HR Department at Pewlett Hackard needs an analysis of potential staff retirements. Because a significant portion of the company is close to requirement, HR would like to set up a mentorship program based on years of experience. This analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify the employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

1. ***Deliverable 1***: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
2. ***Deliverable 2***: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
3. ***Deliverable 3***: A written report on the employee database analysis 

## Results: 
#### Retiring  by Title Table:

* THere are 300,024 employees within the company
* The resuts from the analysis show that 25,916 Senior Engineers, and 24,926 Senior Staff will be eligible to retire. The company's senior level is about 83% of staff close to retirement. 

#### Mentorship Program Table:

* There are 1,549 employees elibible for the mentorship program

## Summary: 

Based on the analysis Pewlett Hackard is facing a signifigant amount of potential employee lossat the senior level due to retirement. This loss of experience certainly provides a risk. Unfortunately with only 1,549 employees eligible for the mentor program there are not enough employees to bridge the gap of retirements. I recommend that a broader or expanded criteria is needed to identify mentors to pair with the retiring mentors.
